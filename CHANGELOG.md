# CHANGELOG

I forked this Version to be able to develop the serverless version parallel to the main branch.
The "Main Branch" is now being converted into a container-based form. The forked part will also be further developed in this form and extended with a config.json and other small updates. The current version of the script can be executed locally and saves the logged data in an SQLite file. This point is also suitable as a starting point for further projects, for example if a Homebridge plugin is realised.
